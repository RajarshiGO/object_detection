
# A YOLO based object detection model using a pre-trained ResNet50 backbone from scratch

![demo](demo.gif)
This project demonstrates how to develop a object detection deep learning model over a pre-trained CNN backbone such as ResNet50 from sratch. The model is trained on the [Global Wheat detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection) challenge data available on [kaggle](https://kaggle.com).
